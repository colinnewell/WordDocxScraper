        * Added a new script, unicode_punctuation.pl to display fancy punctuation like
          smart quotes added by word.  Essentially just displaying unicode (not ascii) 
          punctuation.
        * Added a cleanup of punctuation on the code blocks to make them more copy
          paste friendly.  Convert smart quotes to regular quotes when outputting pod
          code sections.
